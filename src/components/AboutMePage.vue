    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp;I grew up in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Haven,+MI/@43.0517874,-86.2228679,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x881980de5342762f:0x30bca199e5f67b49!8m2!3d43.0630734!4d-86.2283864!16zL20vMHZuOXk?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Grand Haven, MI</a> and have three sons and two dogs. I enjoy hiking, container gardening,
      traveling, and reading. I suppose my journey to becoming a teacher began with my love of reading as a
      child. In college I worked as a Peer Writing Tutor and then spent several years teaching in my son's
      Sunday school classrooms. I quickly fell in love with teaching, so I returned to school and earned my
      Bachelor of Science in Education, then my Master of Arts in Curriculum and Instruction. I have been
      teaching lower elementary (PK-3rd) for the past 12 years, mostly in 1st and 2nd grade. My true passion is
      teaching students how to read and write, although I am certified to teach every subject from K-8th grade.
      <br/>
      &emsp;I am a certified teacher in both Oregon and Michigan. I was the autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
      inclusion teacher for 1st grade for 5 years. I have written and implemented new Science and Social
      Studies curricula for 2nd grade and partnered with <a href="https://oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</a>'s extension program as well
      as the Oregon Watershed Council to provide gardening, creek and ocean/tide pool exploration programs
      to elementary school students in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gold+Beach,+OR+97444/@42.3970221,-124.414168,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x54dace49bf9ae73d:0x121195079f68806d!8m2!3d42.4073334!4d-124.4217741!16zL20vMHpjZ2g?entry=ttu">Gold Beach, Oregon</a>.
